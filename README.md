This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Python involving an unhandled TypeError within a try-except block. The function `function_with_uncommon_error` is designed to handle `ZeroDivisionError`, but it neglects to catch `TypeError` when non-numeric inputs are provided. This results in a silent failure rather than a clear error message. The solution shows how to correct this by adding a dedicated `except TypeError` block to provide informative error messages and improve the robustness of the function.
